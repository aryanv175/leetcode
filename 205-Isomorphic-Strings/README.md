This is a solution to the problem 205. Isomorphic Strings [https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/?envType=study-plan&id=level-1]

Problem Statement: Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
